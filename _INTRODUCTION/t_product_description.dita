            <p> To complete this process, read through the material on this page including a PDF
                file which is the step-by-step documentation presenting the development of process
                documentation. This documentation is a simple document describing the way how my
                documentation came to be at a granular level, and helps you achieve the same
                outputs. I guide you through the whole process of using advanced tools, mainly
                oXygen and GitHub Pages, while writing documentation. The website describes all
                tools used in the documentation process as well as all steps which are necessary to
                do before you start writing. The PDF file is the final product which will support
                you during the writing process, and is available to download. Using this
                documentation you are able to create your own documentation. </p>
            <p>So, letâ€™s get started!</p>
