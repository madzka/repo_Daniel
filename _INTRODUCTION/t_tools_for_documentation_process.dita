                    <b>CONFLUENCE</b> is the project tool I used during my studies where I could
                    manage product requirements and writing documentation. It is the remote
                    workspace where one can collaborate, create and share ideas, documents and many
                    more with other teams. You are also able to assign tasks to specific users or
                    group, leave comments and share your knowledge. </info>

                    <lines id="lines_n44_pm5_4pb"><b>JIRA</b> is the workspace where I created my documentation plan, presented my persona, outputs and styleguide, as well as I uploaded the links to my final project. Then it was assigned to my project supervisor and reviewed by him. Below you can find the screenshot of JIRA board. There you find SPRINTs which show the present status of your project, to do list, reviewed files and completed documents. JIRA is an easy tool for perfect communication between people who work in a team, you share your documentation with your team and get feedback. </lines>

                <info>My documentation is written in oXygen XML Editor where I was able to create
                    high-quality tech documentation. Using oXygen XML Editor I can build, organize
                    and manage my documentation easily. My documentation is written in structured
                    mark-up language such as XML. I also used <i>DITA</i> which is an XML standard,
                    an architectural approach, and a writing methodology, developed by technical
                    communicators for technical communicators. It provides a standardised
                    architectural freamwork for a common structure for content that promotes the
                    consistent creation, sharing, and re-use of content. More information about DITA
                    you can find on <xref

                    hosting website which provides free hosting for open source programs and private
                    repositories. My documentation is uploaded there and available to read and
                    share. In addition, GitHub provides a service called <b>GitHub Pages</b> for
                    quickly creating static web pages. </info>
